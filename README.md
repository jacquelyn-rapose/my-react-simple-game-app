# my-react-simple-game-app

This is the modified version of the react tutorial app from https://reactjs.org/. I have updated the Html and CSS code.

You should have the recent version of Node.js installed. To create a new project for this code, follow the below commands,

> npm install -g create-react-app
> create-react-app my-react-app

Replace all the files in the '../src/' folder with the given files, 'index.css' and 'index.js'. To run the program, follow the below commands,

> cd my-app
> npm start
